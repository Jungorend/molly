* Death Appears
As you wearily rise and dust yourself off, you realize that it's much later than you thought. Everything's dark - even the streetlights. That probably isn't good.

A grey mist rises in the darkness, then coalesces into a towering hooded figure. The figure leans over you. Its hood obscures its features in shadow, and you can only barely glimpse something pale - maybe skeletal - within.

IT IS TIME, it utters.
