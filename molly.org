* Prologue
** Initial
Within the largely untrodden swamps and forests of rural Maryland there lies a mansion. Untouched mostly by the settlement of nearby towns over the past several hundreds years it has grown overrun with vegetation and is choked of sunlight. Here lies a decrepit house, planks on the front porch rotting, black portals with cobwebs where windows appear to have once belonged. Your home. The Molly Mansion.

A figure approaches down what could generously be called a 'path' of broken up gravel and heads towards the front door, where they place upon the frame a notice of indicating that the house?your house, is marked to be destroyed in the coming week. Reading this over their shoulder and deeply upset, you let out a wail. Not expecting you behind them, and acting instinctively, they pivot towards you and put up their fists.

The Fight begins. Reveal cards [[First Fight Goals]] and [[Enemy Options]].

** Enemy Options
Your opponent picks one of the following:
- Your opponent is the mailman. They must Reveal [[Enemy Mailman]].
- Your opponent is the next-door neighbor. They must Reveal [[Enemy Mailman]].
- Your opponent is a brazen kid. They must Reveal [[Enemy Kid]].

(As they Reveal, they place it face-up in their effect area and read aloud).

** Prologue Win
Your assailant falls to the ground unconscious. You carry them a couple miles and drop them off at the lawn of the nearest neighbor, it's their problem now. You weren't going to get any answers from them that weren't, "AIEEE" anyways. You head home and read the note that they'd left on your door.

Reveal card [[First Fight Reward]].
Reveal card [[Call to Action]].

** Prologue Loss
You wake up in front of your house with a headache. The darkness of a recently set sun helps a little, but you'd forgotten how much the living can bust you up. You must have gone invisible when you passed out, you don't see any indication of the earlier trespasser.
Not a great experience, but you're more worried about the note than the intruder. You read it over.

Your Opponent Reveals card [[First Fight Opponent Reward]].
Reveal card [[Call to Action]].

* Exposition
** Call to Action
It seems you should have been paying taxes for the past 200 years. Too late now, but perhaps if the county gets their money they'll also assume someone lives here and not demolish the house? You get to work thinking how you can make money. You assume $500 is probably enough. It's a round number.

Your opponent may choose a different character but they retain any effect cards in their effect area.

If you decide to get a job, Reveal card [[Getting a Job]].
If you decide to survey your house for things to sell, Reveal card [[House Survey]].
If you decide to instead raid the local county office, Reveal card [[Raiding the Office]].

* The Market
** House Survey
You look through your house. Most things here are in various states of decay. You could say they have a sort of sentimental value. Unfortunately they likely wouldn't sell. There is the brooch on the mantelpiece that has been there as long as you can remember. You aren't even sure when you got that. Or how. It's got a gorgeous Emerald gem inset in silver. It would probably fetch a good price. You palm it and look it over. There's your name etched on the back, in what looks like a large dent, but it shouldn't affect its price.

You walk up to a jewelry vendor. Looking you in the eyes, they stand up and throw off their hat. "YOU!" they shout. Oh. It's the person who was in front of your house before. "Here to haunt me are you? Well just come and try it, I'm ready for you this time."

Reveal card [[Market Goals]].
If you win this match, Reveal card [[Sold]].
If you lose, Reveal card [[Dropped It]].

** Sold
Surprising they never seem to learn, ghosts don't die. You didn't knock them out,
after all they are the jeweler. Instead giving your most ghastly voice you utters something like,
"The customer is always right," and they remember their better merchant instincts. You manage to sell them
the trinket for exactly the $500 you were hoping. You even managed to convince them to throw in something extra
for your troubles having to beat them up.

You decide to head to the local office to see if you can pay off your house's debt.
Reveal [[Five Hundred Dollars]]
Reveal [[Cloth]]
Reveal [[Death Appears]]

** Ripped Off
Whew, that was a rush! You may have beaten them, but it was not as close as you would have liked.
Right when it seemed like you might have breathed your last metaphorical breath, you reminded them that
this is no way to treat a customer. Begrudgingly they got back behind their stand and checked out your
brooch. "This is just a piece of junk. I can tell this is not a real gem, and it has this massive dent from
what looks like a bullet in the back. Most I can give you is $300."

You suspect deceit, but you don't really have an alternative so you take it, and hope it's enough.
You make your way to the local office to try and pay.
Reveal [[Three Hundred Dollars]]
Reveal [[Death Appears]]

** Dropped It
That fight was not quite what you were hoping. At the last minute you slipped away but, you can't seem to find your brooch anywhere!
There's not much you can do at this point, you could have lost it more or less anywhere along the major street and people have been
giving you stares ever since you started assaulting that merchant. Reluctantly you make your way home to think of an alternative plan.

Reveal [[Death Appears]]

** Trounced
Now that hurt! Not only did you get wailed on, but then they took your gem! That was clearly no ordinary merchant,
and it seemed like they had planned this in advance, since they fled their stand leaving all their other jewelry behind.
It probably would have fetched a great price, if it was that much more valuable...

There's not much you can do, so you decide to return home to think about how to proceed.
Your opponent Reveals card [[Has Gem Brooch]]
You Reveal [[Death Appears]]

* TODO Death Fight
** Death Appears
As you make your way down a particularly windy road, the sun starts to set on you.
People are not so common at this time of day, and it becomes a lot noisier from the sounds
of the frogs and cicadas. They grow in a feverish pitch you haven't ever heard before, maddeningly
loud, as if announcing the presence of something. "But who?" you think to yourself.

"ME," says Death. "YOU GET USED TO IT EVENTUALLY."

"Oh," you reply. "Oh dear."

"I'VE BEEN...sorry. I've been trying to get you to come to the afterlife for an eternity,
but you just haven't been able to let go of your links to your past life. That brooch used to be
on your beloved cat, and the emotional connection has bound you to this world ever since." Death
replied. "The bullet dent was incidental," Death muttered.

You ask Death if they could repeat everything from the beginning. It's hard to hear anything over these
insanely loud cicadas.

"NO. It's time for you to come with me to the afterlife."

"If you want me, come get me," you say.

"WITH PLEASURE" Death replies, and puts on mask. Suddenly you realize that Death has been the one
following you all day. Death was the merchant, at the house! You didn't catch why they have all the facades.
They probably told you.

Pick one of the following:
If you have the [[Weaver]] card, and [[Cloth]], you may Reveal [[Patching Things Up]]
If you have decide to run, Reveal [[Flight from the Ferryman]]
If you decide to fight, Reveal [[Battle for your Soul]]

** Patching Things Up
"YOUR LAST ANCHOR IN THE WORLD OF THE LIVING HAS BEEN LOST. BID YOUR LAST FAREWELL, AND FOLLOW ME..."
The figure extends one hand. Its cloak is apparently oversized, as its hand remains covered by its sleeve.

Oh, the figure must be asking for some help with its cloak. Acting as quickly on your feet as you can without
having any, you pull out your cloth and start weaving a newer shape to extend out their cloak, and sewing it to the existing one.
The end results look intentionally bad in the way that people would pay top dollar for.

"OH. THANK YOU. I have been meaning to have this replaced but it is so hard to have time off work."

Reveal Card [[Friends Forever]]

** Flight from the Ferryman
Absolutely brilliant. I'm sure nobody has ever tried to escape death before.
The problem is, as you run and run, you notice that you don't seem to be actually getting further away.
Every few yards you look down and recognize you seem to be in the same spot again.

Frustrating, but you're sure death is probably busier than you if you keep this up.
Reveal [[Escape Death]]

** Battle for your Soul
Thinking on it, Death definitely seems to know where you are most of the time, so
it makes sense a lot of people would be quite happy if you managed to be the first
to defeat death!

Death senses your intentions. "Ah, a fight for your soul? Very well," and pulls out a chess board that somehow was contained in their cloak.

You clock Death right in the face.
Reveal [[Fighting Death]].

** TODO Fighting Death
Text here on special rules conditions.

Reveal card [[Death Fight Goals]].
If you win this fight, reveal [[Beat up Death]]
If you lose this fight, reveal [[Lost to Death]]

** Beat up Death
You did it! You are the first to beat death! Although now that you think about it,
you *have* fought them several times in the past now. Ah well.
"Fine. I didn't want your soul anyways," Death says in an obviously hurt tone, and disappeared
in a puff of grayish smoke.

You return to your home, and enjoy a few centuries of quiet.
GOOD END: Won the Battle for your Soul
Reveal [[Ending]]

** Lost to Death
The chess match probably wouldn't have gone better, but it would have
hurt an awful lot less. You resign yourself to your fate.

Death turns its faceless cloak towards you and says, "The chess match probably
wouldn't have gone better, but it would have hurt an awful lot less."

Took the words from your mouth. "WELL THEN, WE DEPART FOR THE AFTERLIFE"

You unwillingly depart from the world of the living.
BAD END: Paradise

Reveal card: [[Ending]]

** Friends Forever
"IF YOU WANT TO STAY...I guess I can't refuse you at this point. The house was never actually at risk of being bulldozed. I will
see to it that everyone forgets that it exists. Hopefully I can come by in the future and we can play some Exceed or something?"

Reveal card [[Reaper Ally]]
GOOD ENDING: Friends Forever.
Reveal card [[Ending]].

** Escape Death
The spaces on the edges of the battleground wrap around. If you are pushed or move beyond the corner, the first movement places you on the space on the opposite end.
Likewise ranges extend to these sides and beyond.
Molly sets her initial life to 15 for this battle. Each time Molly wraps around from the edge of the board furthest from her starting position to the one closest,
her opponent loses 10 life. If Molly wraps the board in the opposite direction, her opponent gains 10 life. These effects occur even if the result of being pushed or pulled.
Strikes that would kill your opponent instead only reduce them to 1 hitpoint.

Reveal Card [[Escape Goals]]
If you win this Fight, Reveal [[Got Away]]
If you lose this Fight, Reveal [[Death Caught Up]]

** Got Away
Whew. That was a frightful flight. You made it though! It did sound like death knew where you live,
but on the other hand, the shrug of shoulders as you finally started to clear away suggest you made yourself
enough a nuisance you're probably fine.

You return home to your lovely home to enjoy the next several centuries of quiet.
Good End: Outran Death
Reveal card [[Ending]]

** Death Caught Up
Try as you might to get away, Death has dogged your every step until you find yourself out of breath. It looks like you won't be able
to keep your house after all.
"Come, it is time for us to go," he says.

You lost your last chance to keep your home, you are unwillingly dragged away to Paradise.

Bad End: Paradise
Reveal card [[Ending]]

* TODO Job
** Getting a Job
Makes sense that if you need money you need someone to give you it.
Since you don't keep many things at home, this seems to be the most reasonable
way to make the money. You can probably make $500 in an evening. Hundreds of years
of experience is a pretty good selling point.

You find yourself a wonderful office job. The work is mindless, the flourescent lights
above barely seem to work, everyone seems to be completely drained of any life.

It reminds you what you're working for.

You just have one problem.
Reveal card [[Problem]]

** Problem
One of your fellow employees approaches you. "Are you alright?" they ask, "You seem a little...pale."
"If you need to take off, we can start your training day tomorrow instead."

"No," you reply, "I need to make this money now."

"Well if that's the case, prove to me you're up to it!" they reply, and flip your desk.

Reveal cards [[Office Goals]]
Your opponent reveals card [[Undercover Trainer]]
If you win this fight, reveal card [[Fit Employee]]
If you lose this fight, reveal card [[Bad First Day]]

** Fit Employee
Your boss walks in, "That's the sort of enthusiasm we need around here! Keep up the good work."
You get up off the unconscious face of your coworker, and return back to your desk.
After a long day of work, you are given the $500 dollars you need. Since you have what you needed,
time to ghost this company in the future. Good thing you never gave them any contact info.

Reveal Card [[Tax Office]].

** TODO Bad First Day
** Tax Office
Eventually, you find your way to the county tax office (not without getting lost several times and getting screamed at by whomever you tried to ask for directions).

The receptionist directs you to "take a number" without even looking up. You retrieve a small, numbered ticket, then immediately drop it. In your instinctive rush to catch it before it flutters too far, you crash into someone, and both of you are sent sprawling.

Two tickets lie on the ground between you as you rise, slightly dazed: 99 and 66. You're not sure which one was yours.

"Not again," sighs the person you bowled over. You meet their gaze and flinch.

Both of you immediately glance at the display indicating which ticket is up next. It currently reads 65, and the estimated wait time until the next representative is available reads... 75 minutes.

You lock eyes with your foe. The 66 ticket is exactly midway between you. It's time to fight like you've never fought before.

During this battle, when a player initiates a Strike while in the center of the arena, their attack has +2 Power.

If you lose, Reveal [[Evicted]].

** TODO Free Real Estate
** TODO Evicted


* TODO Raid
** Raiding the Office

As you wearily rise and dust yourself off, you realize that it's much later than you thought. Everything's dark - even the streetlights. That probably isn't good.

A grey mist rises in the darkness, then coalesces into a towering hooded figure. The figure leans over you. Its hood obscures its features in shadow, and you can only barely glimpse something pale - maybe skeletal - within.

IT IS TIME, it utters.

* TODO Fight Goals
** First Optional Goal
Nice work! Way to punch. You are quite violent. You hesitate less when it comes to escalating situations. Your Exceed costs one less.

* TODO Rewards
** Enemy Mailman
You are a mailman. You were only delivering another letter when you hear a unearthly wail from behind you and only can assume this was another dog not properly leashed. You've had enough! Let your fists fly!

(Role)
Once per turn, you may choose to Close or Retreat 1, then regain your action.

** Enemy Neighbor
This house and the surrounded forest has always had an ominous feel to it and you never liked what it does to your property values. As the only neighbor for miles you've worked hard to get the local county to finally do something about this eyesore, so much you couldn't wait to deliver the notice yourself. Being nearby gives you goosebumps, so when you hear a scream behind you, you instinctively tense up and defend yourself.

(Role)
For every 2 cards in your Gauge, you gain +1 Power when wild-swinging.

** TODO Enemy Kid
It should be a grown-up's job to deliver notices, but everyone old enough is too leery of the house deep in the forest to actually go near it. This notice has been waiting to be posted for weeks. When your parents weren't letting you go to a friend's party because it was going to be happening late during a weekday, you decided to show you were more of an adult than them by doing something they weren't brave enough for.

You didn't expect the house to actually be so creepy, or to feel like you're freezing up as you hear a gasp behind you turn into a full on scream. You'll show them you're not scared though, en garde!

(Role)
When initiating a Strike, add up your speed, armor, and guard. Then subtract this value from your opponent's Speed. You gain this much Power (minimum of 0).

** First Fight Reward
You root through their pockets. You find a weird metal box with glass on one side. Pressing a button on it causes a bright flash that nearly spooks you. Looking back at the glass, it shows you a near perfect painting of the surroundings you had it pointed at. Could come in handy.

On card reveal you can choose to use this card. If you do, you have Ignore Guard. Your opponent can spent 1 Gauge to cancel that effect. If you used this effect, even if it was cancelled, it is sealed for the remainder of the match, then placed back in your effect area.

** First Fight Opponent Reward
What was that? It disappeared as you hit it. Whatever it was, it clearly wasn't a dog. You already did what you came to this house for, so time to get out of here and maybe buy a gun.

You can choose to chuck your gun at your opponent, using the following effect-Hit: +1 Power and Push 1. If you use this effect, this card is placed in your opponent's Reveal area.

** Awakening
It's starting to come back to you. *This* is how you get things done! Perhaps it always was? Back in your first century you used to be a...

Select one of the following:
- Weaver: Reveal Card [[Weaver]].
- Cobbler: Reveal Card [[Cobbler]].
- Lecturer: Reveal Card [[Lecturer]].
- Molly: Wait nevermind, reminiscing never helped anyone.

** Enemy Crossed Up
Molly certainly doesn't have dead-ly reflexes. You find yourself speeding by in a jiffy and you start to notice the ways she struggles to move.
Win conditions changed to [[Ripped Off]] and lose condition to [[Trounced]]

Whenever you move past Molly, your next Strike has +2 Power.
** Weaver
You remember. You used to weave...magic. Manipulating the forces of nature allowed you to blast crazy magic from a distance. Open bag 1.

Remove both "The Fast Mixup" cards from your deck and replace them with the contents of the bag, they are part of your your deck now instead.
** Cobbler
You remember. You used to cobble...faces. Cobbler? Clobber-er? It's been a long time. Open bag 2.

Remove both "Fireball" cards from your deck and replace them with the contents of the bag, they are part of your your deck now instead.
** Lecturer
You remember. You could call yourself a lecturer. You would educate people to concepts of pain, and they got up to speed quickly. You were never the most patient. Open bag 3.

Remove both "The Fast Mixup" cards from your deck and replace them with the contents of the bag, they are part of your your deck now instead.

** Cloth
With the extra money you found, you buy some nice cloth you found at a vendor on the way. It's the color
of ebony darkness, just the way you like it.

** TODO Five Hundred Dollars
That's a lot of money! Or at least it was last time you checked. You remember seeing
people buy houses for this much.

** TODO Three Hundred Dollars
This one exists if you got ripped off
** TODO Has Gem Brooch
** TODO Reaper Ally
In future games, even if you reset the characters othewise, you may start iwth this card in your effect area.
If you do so, Reveal cards in bag X. (This is a new character card or two, to make them a puppet character.
Origin of attacks is reaper if max range is 3 or less. Effects that move, push or pull can be declared against either
Molly or Reaper, even if actions otherwise affect the other.)

** Ending
You have completed the story. You may set back up the deck again by returning all mystery cards to the mystery deck and resetting molly to her
original cards, or you may decide to continue playing fights with your current Molly deck.
** TODO Undercover Trainer
It's like they don't notice you've already met them once. You're pretty confident
you know their tricks this time, and they won't be ready as long as you stay undercover.

Whenever you have the option to use your Role card, you may choose not to. If you do use your Role card,
this card is sealed.
